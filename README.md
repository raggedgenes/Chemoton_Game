Ganti's Chemoton theory visualized.

This was an attempt to gamify [Tibor Ganti's chemoton theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoton). This is how far I could get using QT and SFML together for some perverse reason (probably to make life more difficult.)


Here is a screenshot of the app in the repo:

The code depends on the SFML lib. (<a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">Link</a>)
